I.MX OpenWRT Quick Start

This is a quick start guide for imx specific usage, like introducing
how to configure, build, and deploy OpenWrt to imx boards, so that
users can bring up the board without difficulty.

1. Target support
----------------------------
* ARMv8 64-bit
  IMX8MPlus_LPDDR4	(SD boot)
  IMX8MMini_LPDDR4	(SD boot)
  IMX8MNano_LPDDR4	(SD boot)
  IMX8MQuad_LPDDR4	(SD boot)
  IMX93EVK			(SD boot)

* cortexa7 and cortexa9
  imx6				(not included in this doc)

2. Build
--------
Before configuration and build, update and install package feeds.

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install build-essential ccache ecj fastjar file g++ gawk \
  gettext git java-propose-classpath libelf-dev libncurses5-dev \
  libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev python python2.7-dev python3 unzip wget \
  python3-distutils python3-setuptools python3-dev rsync subversion \
  swig time xsltproc zlib1g-dev
$ ./scripts/feeds update -a
$ ./scripts/feeds install -a

* make menuconfig
  Target System:   "NXP imx"
  Subtarget:       (Select subtarget "NXP i.MX8 boards")
  Target Profile:  (Select device, or "Multiple devices")
  Target Devices:  (Select devices. Available when Target Profile is "Multiple devices")
  Target Images:   (Disable "GZip images" if you don't want to unzip manually to use the images.)

  Note 1: For ARMv8 platform, please select the compile toolchain as follows:
	[*] Advanced configuration options (for developers)  --->
		[*]   Toolchain Options  --->
			Binutils Version (Binutils 2.37)  --->
			GCC compiler Version (gcc 11.x)  --->

  Note 2: The first time make menuconfig would create a .config file which
  would include all dependencies for selected target. After that, make
  menuconfig still could be used to modify packages. If want to change
  other target, please remove .config and make menuconfig to select again.
  Otherwise the packages selected in .config would be a mess.

* make kernel_menuconfig (optional)
  Enable/Disable kernel options

* make download (or make download -j<n>)

* make (or make -j<n>)

* Final firmware/image
  Path:               bin/targets/imx/<subtarget>/
  Image for SD card:  openwrt-imx-<subtarget>-<device>-<rootfs>-sdcard.img.gz
  Sysupgrade images:  openwrt-imx-<subtarget>-<device>-<rootfs>-sysupgrade.bin
  Take imx8mplus_lpddr4_evk board for example:
  Will genterate: bin/targets/imx/imx8/openwrt-imx-imx8-imx8mplus-squashfs-sdcard.img

3. Deploy
---------
The *-sdcard.img is an all-in-one image including all things for OpenWrt staring up.

3.1 Program sdcard.img to SD card
---------------------------------
*-sdcard.img could be programmed to SD card in either u-boot environment
or linux environment. After programming, configure the board to boot
from SD card.

* u-boot environment

  => tftp a0000000 <image_name>-sdcard.img
  => mmc write a0000000 0 a0000

  Note: The default sdcard.img size is about 200MB. a0000 is the block number
  for 320MB. blk_num = filesize / 512.

* linux environment

  $ sudo dd if=./<image_name>-sdcard.img of=/dev/sdx bs=1M && sync

  Note: Need to check the SD card device name to replace "sdx".
